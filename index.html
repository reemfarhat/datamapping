        <h4>December 2 2021</h4>
        <h4>By Reem Farhat</h4>

        <p> The Biden Administration's $1 trillion infrastructure bill includes a budget to increase internet access in rural America. </p>

        <p> In New Mexico, nearly 11% of school aged children do not have access to the internet. In New Hampshire and Washington, that number is only about 2%. </p> 

        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the number of children with internet access nationally since many children had to learn online, but the gap still exists. According to Corian Zacher, an attorney and researcher with Next Century Cities, a nonprofit which works to address broadband access inequities, low income students showed greater learning loss than their higher income classmates during the pandemic partly because of a lack of internet access.</p>

        <p>“We're seeing a lot of really creative solutions with COVID,” said Corian Zacher, an attorney and researcher with Next Century Cities, a nonprofit which works to address broadband access inequities.  “COVID really highlighted the need for ubiquitous connectivity for everyone, and really shined a light on especially the needs of people in terms of being able to afford Internet access and have high enough quality access.” </p>
